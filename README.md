# Hostpital-API

## Problem Statement
We’re have design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been allocated by the
govt for testing and quarantine + well being of COVID-19 patients
- There can be 2 types of Users
    - Doctors
    - Patients
- Doctors can log in
- Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps
    - Register the patient in the app (using phone number, if the patient already exists, just
      return the patient info in the API)
    - After the checkup, create a Report
- Patient Report will have the following fields
    - Created by doctor
    - Status (You can use enums if you want to):
    - Can be either of: [Negative, Travelled-Quarantine, Symptoms-Quarantine,
       Positive-Admit]
    - Date
 
## Routes
Required Routes
- /doctors/register → with username and password
- /doctors/login → returns the JWT to be used
- /patients/register
- /patients/:id/create_report
- /patients/:id/all_reports → List all the reports of a patient oldest to latest
